					Out of all of these things we did in angular, I really like the data binding in Angular.

				<section class="fourthslide">
			
					<h3 background='yellow">Data Binding</h3>
					Data Binding in AngularJS is the automatic synchronization of data between model and the view components.
					 The view is a projection of the model at
					all times. When the model changes, the view reflects the change, and vice versa.
					There is huge different between Data Binding in Classiscal Template Systems and Angular Templates.
				</section>
							
				<section class="fourthslide">
					<h3 background="yellow">Classical Template</h3>
					Most templating systems bind data in only one direction: they merge template and 
					model components together into a view. After the merge occurs, changes to the model
					or related sections of the view are NOT automatically reflected in the view. Worse, 
					any changes that the user makes to the view are not reflected in the model.
					This means that the developer has to write code that constantly syncs the view with
					the model and the model with the view.
				</section>
				<section class="fourthslide">
					<h3 background="yellow">AngularJS Template</h3>
					AngularJS templates work differently. First the template (which is the uncompiled 
					HTML along with any additional markup or directives) is compiled on the browser.
					The compilation step produces a live view. Any changes to the view are immediately 
					reflected in the model, and any changes in the model are propagated to the view. 
					The model is the single-source-of-truth for the application state, greatly simplifying 
					the programming model for the developer. You can think of the view as simply an 
					instant projection of your model.

				       Because the view is just a projection of the model, the controller is completely separated 
					from the view and unaware of it. This makes testing a snap because it is easy to test your
					controller in isolation without the view and the related DOM/browser dependency.
